## Hi there! This is Tony ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer based in the Bay Area, California, and a polyglot who enjoys experimenting with different programming languages. My current favorites are TypeScript, Elixir, and Go. Iâ€™m passionate about all things webâ€”especially Svelte, Elixir, Go, PWAs, local-first development, and containerized deployments. Outside of coding, I love climbing and calisthenics. :)

You can find my personal website at [tonydang.com](https://tonydang.com), and reach me at [tony@tonydang.com](mailto:tony@tonydang.com) or on most social platforms (links in my profile).
